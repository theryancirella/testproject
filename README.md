## FAQs

- **Can I use XYZ framework?** You can use any web-based frameworks or tools available, but for your server programming you need to use node.js. Your client-side language should be either JavaScript or TypeScript.

1. Our project is a pong multiplayer game with high score charts


**Instructions to play the game**

1. If you want to play on multiple computers you MUST change the ip in script.js (on lines 40 and 72) to

*your_ip_adress*:6969 or *your_ip_adress*:8082 for lines 40 and 72 respectively

2. Then to play just run the server on 1 computer (node server.js) and type the url *your_ip_adress*:3000

you can do this on two computers, then all you need to do is login and play!

If you want to just test this on 1 computer you can skip the ip stuff and once the server starts you just type localhost:3000 to the url



Only 2 people can play, if you login with more than 2 people you need to restart the server.
