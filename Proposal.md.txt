Webware Final Project Proposal
	We decided to create a website that has a “pong” game. The game will either be local multiplayer or 
networked multiplayer. If we cannot get networked multiplayer to work we will use local multiplayer and create 
a global chat window for real-time communication. We will use node.js database to store and display high scores.
 When opening the website, the user(s) will be asked to enter a username and then the game will only display high
 scores for that username.
